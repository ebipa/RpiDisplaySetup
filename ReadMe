This package setups up for Raspberry PI 7" touchscreen display
and also for HDMI display on HDMI 0 or HDMI 1
It may also work on other DSI displays with some or all functionality

VenusOS already includes much of the support for the RPI display
    the touch screen calibration included in the image appears to work fine
        even if the display is rotated 180 degrees
    the backlight kernal module appears to be in place

This script:
    adds screensaver (blanking) and brightness control from Venus GUI
    adds activating a local GUI
    resets the max and default values for /Settings/Gui/Brightness to accommodate the RPI display max of 255

Do NOT install this package if you do NOT want a local display (running Venus "headless")

This script is designed to run without any command line interaction e.g., from the Package Manager in the GUI
	Without the command line, this script discovers the display type automatically.
	The package must be partially installed, then Venus rebooted in order to discover the display type
		and finish the installation.
	Note: that HDMI 1 can not be auto-discovered -- only RPI and HDMI 0.
		I'm actually not sure if HDMI 1 is supported at all in Venus OS!!

The script can also be run from the command line.
	The user is prompted for display type: RPI, HDMI 0, HDMI 1,] or CUSTOM, skipping the auto-discovery mechanism.

	Selecting CUSTOM allows the user to specify the /sys/class/... devices for blanking and dimming

	Files for these custom devices are stored in /data/setupOptions/RpiDisplaySetup and can be edited manually.
	If present, these files overwrite the display type selection

This script will also be called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

Only the RPI touchscreen supports dimming (other DSI displays might also)
	while HDMI does not support any dimming mechanism.

Some HDMI displays have no backlight control. In this case the screen will go black 
but may still glow if backlight remains on

Setup:

The easiest way to install this or other of my packages is to first install SetupHelper (v4.0 or later),
then use Package Manager from the GUI. Refer to the SetupHelper ReadMe for instructions.
