This package setups up for Raspberry PI 7" touchscreen display
and also for HDMI display on HDMI 0

VenusOS already includes much of the support for the RPI display
    the touch screen calibration included in the image appears to work fine
        even if the display is rotated 180 degrees
    the backlight kernal module appears to be in place

This script adds:
    screensaver (blanking) and brightness control from Venus GUI
    activating a local GUI

Do NOT install this package if you do not want a local display (run Venus "headless")

For HDMI displays, no brightness control is possible, only screensaver

This script should be run manually initally.
It will then called from reinstallMods to reinstall functionality after a Venus update

Setup:

The easiest way to install this code IF the Venus device has internet access is to run the following command:

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/RpiDisplaySetup/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/RpiDisplaySetup-current /data/RpiDisplaySetup

If not, run the following commands on a computer that does have internet access

wget https://github.com/kwindrem/TankRepeater/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz RpiDisplaySetup.tar.gz

then move the resulting .tar.gx file to a USB stick,
put the stick in the Venus device and reboot.


You must also install SetupHelper

wget -qO - https://github.com/kwindrem/SetupHelper/archive/current.tar.gz | tar -xzf - -C /data
mv /data/SetupHelper-current /data/SetupHelper

or

wget https://github.com/kwindrem/TankRepeater/archive/current.tar.gz
mv current.tar.gz SetupHelper.tar.gz

Once both packages are installed run setup and follow the prompts.
/data/RpiDisplaySetup/setup


You will need root access to the Venus device. Instructions can be found here:
https://www.victronenergy.com/live/ccgx:root_access
The root password needs to be reentered following a Venus update.
Setting up an authorization key (see documentation referenced above) will save time and avoid having to reset the root password after each update.
